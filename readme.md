# termodoro

## Temporary solution to audio

Move the audio file in src/assets to the dist/ folder. Still working on that.

## Install

Run this one folder above, calling the actual termodoro folder

```bash
$ npm install --global ./termodoro
```

## Dev

```bash
$ yarn build
$ yarn dev
```

## In another terminal

```bash
$ termodoro
```

## Todo

- increase volume of audio
- fix audio issue (audio file need to be in dist, that's awful)
- do some refactoring
- fix readme to have some images and etc
- it works on windows
  - afplay just exists on mac :l
