Termodoro is a react app running on terminal that creates a pomodoro with traditional timings (25 min working, 5 min resting).
## Dependencies
It needs `npm` and `node => v16`.

## Install

1 - Download this folder
2 - Run the command `npm install --global ./termodoro` one folder above the folder
3 - Now you can use `termodoro` to work with.

## Dev
You can run the commands to have your installation working in real time, so you can do updates on the code.

```
yarn build
yarn dev
```

## Todo

- it's weird, depending on the terminal window size
- increase the volume of audio
- fix the audio issue. Audio file needs to be moved the audio file in src/assets to the dist/ folder to work. 
- do some refactoring
- it should work on windows
  - afplay just exists on mac :l
